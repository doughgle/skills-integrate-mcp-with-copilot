I enjoyed this interactive tutorial, "Integrate MCP with Github Copilot" and think you might too.

Here's what you can learn:

+ Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Configuration: Setting up and connecting the GitHub MCP server to Copilot
+ Agent Mode with MCP: Using natural language to interact with external services through MCP tools
+ GitHub Repository Research: Searching for and analyzing similar projects using MCP capabilities
+ Issue Management & Implementation: Triaging, creating, and managing GitHub issues through Copilot, then having Copilot solve issues for you

One highlight that made me smile:

+ copilot looked and 16 issues and prioritised top 3 with justification. Top issue was that "Github Skills" was from the Mergington High School CCA missing (ha! this AI system has business context! 😂 ). If I'd skimmed 16 issue titles, I may have missed that.

One drawback that broke the tut flow:

- observed some requests to Claude Sonnet 4.5 taking 90 seconds to receive a response. By comparison, gpt-4o-mini responded in 500ms.
